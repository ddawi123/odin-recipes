    <h3> Description: </h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is an Italian dish consisting of broad, flat pasta sheets layered with fillings such as meat sauce (ragù), béchamel sauce, cheese (like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and vegetables, then baked in an oven until the cheese is melted and the dish is hot. The word "lasagna" can refer to both the wide, flat noodle itself and the layered, baked dish.
